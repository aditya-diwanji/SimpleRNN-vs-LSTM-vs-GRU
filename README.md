📘 Empirical Comparison of SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU for Sentiment Classification
🧠 Project Overview

This project presents a structured empirical comparison of three recurrent neural network architectures:

SimpleRNN

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

The objective is to analyze how each architecture handles long-term dependencies in text classification tasks using the IMDB movie review dataset for binary sentiment classification.

Rather than focusing solely on final accuracy, this study evaluates:

Convergence behavior

Training stability

Generalization performance

Parameter efficiency
